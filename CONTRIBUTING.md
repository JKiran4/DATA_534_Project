# Contributing

In this project, we will be using Github for version control. Collaborators will use the working branch to pull the repository onto their local system for individual workflows. They will then add any work they have completed
into this branch and push back to the working branch on Github. After review by all group members and every member is in agreement of the changes, the working branch will be merged into the main branch.

An overview of branches can be found here [Github Branches]([https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)).
